	description "Once a self-sufficient ship capable of housing upwards of 200 people comfortably, this Bactrian has been no less than gutted by the Korath Technovirus. Almost all of its life support systems have been removed and replaced with shield emitters and extra hull plating. Some particularly large protrusions from the Bactrian even house additional turret mounts, making it a terrifyingly capable warship."
